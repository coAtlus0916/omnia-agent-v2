# Four-plane map

Surface 只采集/展示；Worker 解析、验证、编译计划；Core Store 持久化；Connector 只托管签名 Operation。
# Implementation map

Version 0.2.41 keeps the four-plane boundary. Worker owns a single detached Return execution slot, while every target completion is persisted through existing Core Store ports and every Surface refresh reads current Core Return progress. Worker remote target identities continue to bind Workspace + element kind + external element ID + derived GRA name and the relevant field/relation ID. Core, UI and signed Operation contracts are unchanged.

- Frontend: `frontend/surface.json` plus generic two-column workflow renderer, native picker/drop staging, explicit confirmation, post-render background action dispatch, signed-template Save As, artifacts, progress/issues, and issue editors.
- Worker: `middle/worker.cjs` owns XLSX parsing, governance interpretation, plan/output compilation, revisions, and orchestration.
- Backend: migration plus Core structured Run/artifact/template/provenance/issue/intent/command/evidence registries.
- Connector capability: `connector-capability/operation.ofop`; Connector Core supplies only signed route transport, session binding, gates, and Operation hosting.
- Machine-readable mapping: `contracts/implementation-map.json`; runtime I/O/event/error/Store ports are in `contracts/feature-runtime.json`, and signed test inventory/vectors are under `tests/`.
